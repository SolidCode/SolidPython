    # of the OpenSCAD variable $t, but I can't think of a way to get a

    # all out in the SCAD code for each case, with an if/else tree.  Depending
    # on the number of steps, this could create hundreds of times more SCAD

    # in steps iterations, meaning that we won't officially reach $t =1.

    # to be animated with an identical number of steps to the way it was

    '''
    A rotational extrusion is a Linear Extrusion with a twist, literally.
    Unfortunately, it can not be used to produce a helix for screw threads
    as the 2D outline must be normal to the axis of rotation, ie they need
    to be flat in 2D space.

    The 2D shape needs to be either completely on the positive, or negative
    side (not recommended), of the X axis. It can touch the axis, i.e. zero,
    however if the shape crosses the X axis a warning will be shown in the
    console windows and the rotate\_extrude() will be ignored. If the shape
    is in the negative axis the faces will be inside-out, you probably don't
    want to do that; it may be fixed in the future.

    :param convexity: The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.
