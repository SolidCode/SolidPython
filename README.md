PyOpenSCAD/ SolidPython
-----------------------

PyOpenSCAD is a generalization of Phillip Tiefenbacher's openscad module, 
found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481.  It generates valid OpenSCAD 
code from Python code with minimal overhead.  Here's a simple example:
    
This Python code: 

```from pyopenscad import *
d = difference()(
    cube(10),
    sphere(15)
)
print scad_render( d)
```

Generates this OpenSCAD code:

```difference(){
	cube(10);
	sphere(15);
}
```

Steps to using PyOpenSCAD
-------------------------
*   ```from pyopenscad import *```
*   call ```use( "/path/to/scadfile.scad")``` or ```include("/path/to/scadfile.scad")```
    for any included SCAD code
*   OpenSCAD uses curly-brace blocks ({}) to create its tree.  PyOpenSCAD uses
    parentheses with comma-delimited lists.
    *   OpenSCAD:
```difference(){
    cube(10);
    sphere(15);
}
```
    *   PyOpenSCAD:
```d = difference()(
    cube(10),  # Note the comma between each element!
    sphere(15)
)
```
           
*   Call ```scad_render( py_scad_obj)``` to generate SCAD code. This returns a string 
    of valid OpenSCAD code.
*   *or*: call ```scad_render_to_file( py_scad_obj, filepath)``` to
    store that code in a file. 
    *   If 'filepath' is open in the OpenSCAD IDE and Design =>
        'Automatic Reload and Compile' is checked, calling
        scad_render_to_file() from Python will load the object in
        the IDE.
    *   Alternately, you could call OpenSCAD's command line and render straight 
        to STL.   

Extra syntactic sugar
---------------------
### Basic operators
Following Elmo MÃ¤ntynen's suggestion, SCAD objects override 
the basic operators + (union), - (difference), and * (intersection).
So
```c = cylinder( r=10, h=5) + cylinder( r=2, h=30)```
is the same as:
```c = union()(
    cylinder( r=10, h=5),
    cylinder( r=2, h=30)
)
```
Likewise:
```c = cylinder( r=10, h=5)
c -= cylinder( r=2, h=30)
```
is the same as:
```c = difference()(
    cylinder( r=10, h=5),
    cylinder( r=2, h=30)
)
```

SP_utils
--------
I've been adding utilities to sp_utils.py.  Currently these include:
### Basic color library
I took this from someone on Thingiverse and I'm 
ashamed that I can't find the original source.  I owe someone some 
attribution.
    
### Directions: (up, down, left, right, forward, back) for arranging things:
```up(10)(
    cylinder()
)
```
seems a lot clearer to me than:
```transform( [0,0,10])(
    cylinder()
)
```
    
Again, I took this from someone's SCAD work and have lost track of the 
original author.  My apologies.
    
### Arcs
I've found this useful for fillets and rounds.
```arc( rad=10, 90, 210)``` draws an arc of radius 10 counterclockwise from 90 to 210 degrees. 
```arc( rad=10, 0, 90, invert=True )``` draws the portion of a 10x10 square NOT in a 90 degree circle of radius 10.
This is the shape you need to add to make fillets or remove to make rounds.
    
    
### Bill Of Materials
Put ```@part()``` before any method that defines a part, then 
call ```bill_of_materials()``` after the program is run, and all parts will be 
counted, priced and reported. Check it out.
    
Advantages
----------
Because you're using Python, a lot of things are easy that would be hard or 
impossible in pure OpenSCAD.  Among these are:
* recursion
* built-in dictionary types
* mutable, slice-able list and string types
* external libraries (images! 3D geometry!  web-scraping! ...)
